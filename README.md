# ChatDocs
## Making Documentations Interactive
Idea of ChatDocs is to find relevant documentation material in no time. Even if you are juggling with topics. 

## Behind the scenes
We are using a complete RAG based architecture to fetch the relevant links and content from QdrantDB.

## Why is it helpful?
It is fast and efficient. We are using the capabilities of GPT-4O nano. It is fast and gives relevant information in no time
