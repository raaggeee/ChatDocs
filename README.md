# ChatDocs
## Making Documentations Interactive
Idea of ChatDocs is to find relevant documentation material in no time. Even if you are juggling with topics. 

## Behind the scenes
We are using a complete RAG based architecture to fetch the relevant links and content from QdrantDB.

## Why is it helpful?
It is fast and efficient. We are using the capabilities of GPT-4O nano. It is fast and gives relevant information in no time

## Further Improvements:
- [ ]  : Use caching for better user interaction.
- [ ]  : Using an AI Orchestration for better interaction
- [ ]  : Improve the UI/UX
- [ ]  : Need to test how it works well with other websites
- [ ]  : Use Database and manage Qdrant DB for efficiently storing the data.
